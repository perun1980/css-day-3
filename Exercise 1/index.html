      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <hr />
      <li>3 egg whites,</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt,</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar,</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch,</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice.</li>
      <h3>Directions</h3>

      <li>
        "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with
        parchment paper. Draw a 9 inch circle on the parchment. An easy way to
        do this is to draw around the outside of a 9 inch pan with a pencil."</li>
      <li>"In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to whip. Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. Mix together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into meringue with lemon juice."
      <li>"Spread a layer of meringue to fit circle on parchment, approximately 1/4 inch thick. With remainder of mixture, pipe or spoon swirls around the edges to form a shallow bowl shape."</li></li>
      <li>"In a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of confectioners sugar, and whip until thickened. Decorate with fruit of your choice; strawberries are excellent."</li>
